On 16th April, 1934 Indera Chand Kejriwal by a deed of assignment assigned his interest in the decree to Mahadeo Prasad Tibrewalla, the respondent in this appeal.
A sum of Rs. 10,000/ was paid to the decree holder on the 7th September, 1939 towards part satisfaction of the decree.
The salient terms of the settlement may be stated as follows: (1) That the total dues on the date came to Rs. 1,10,000/ .
In passing, the learned single Judge also expressed the view that the execution was barred under section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
We shall first dispose of the point of limitation.
When in the year 1929 there was an order for sale of the mortgaged properties it appears some payments were made and finally accounts were settled in the year 1934.
In the year 1945 steps were taken for substitution of the heirs and legal representatives of Ram Chander Saraogi, one of the deceased judgment debtors.
She was, therefore, undoubtedly a legal representative competent to represent the estate of Sewbux Saraogi.
Reference in this connection may be made to the decision of this Court in the case of The Andhra Bank Ltd. vs R. Srinivasan and Others, (1) decision relied upon by the Appellate Bench.
It was conceded and rightly so by learned counsel for the appellants that the execution was not barred under Article 136 of the .
We accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.
